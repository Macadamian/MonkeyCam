MonkeyCam
=========

An augmented reality app, point the camera at someone's face and see 
them for who they really are! Watch as your friends faces get replaced 
by a monkey face!

Designed to experiment with Android's face recognition functionality.


This is an app that was developped in our spare time.  It is available 
on Google Play http://tinyurl.com/cu5mjsf.  

For more info on how the face detection works you can refer to the 
following blog post http://thefiles.macadamian.com/2012/04/real-time-face-detection-with-android.html

We do not have an active maintainer.  We are releasing the code under 
the Apache License 2.0 in the hopes that you may find it interesting 
and/or useful.  If you do, we'd be happy to hear about it.
